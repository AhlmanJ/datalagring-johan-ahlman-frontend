**Hi! 

I'm studying to become a .NET Developer at EC Utbildning and this is my fourth school assignment. This assignment was done for the course "Data Storage". The main focus of this assignment was to carry out modeling, normalization and implementation of a relational database. However, in order to be able to test the backend part wich was the main focus of the assignment, i would also create a frontend that integrated with the backend through the Endpoints that i had created in my minimalAPI.

NOTE! ---- > This code were built by AI and tested by me!

This repository represents the frontend part and i was allowed to use AI to generate the code, as long as i understood and could explain the code. During the process building the code with chatGPT i tested all parts of the code to make sure that all parts integrated and responded with the backend. After the code was built, i asked chatGPT to do a test where i was asked questions about all parts of the code and i had to explain to the AI what the code does and why. I was approved by the AI ​​(I have saved screenshots of the AI ​​answers about my knowledge in case it is needed to pass the course)

**<u>Why use AI when you're still learning?</u>
- Because the main focus of this assignment was data storage and backend and i wanted to spend as much time as possible lerning the backend.
- Even though i have used AI to build the code for the frontend, i have still learned more about the frontend during this process because i had to read through and understand the code that the AI built.

**<u>How do you use the frontend with backend?</u>
- Start the project in Visual Studio Code.
- Open the console in Visual Studio Code ( Click on "Terminal" and select "New terminal" ).
- In the console, insert: npm run dev
- You should now get a link to a " http://localhost:****/
- Hold "ctrl" + left click on the link.
- The program will now open a web page where you can see the frontend.

**NOTE! You must start the server and run the backend part if you want to test the frontend functions. ---> See my other repository for this assignment on GitHub named " datalagring-johan-ahlman ".
